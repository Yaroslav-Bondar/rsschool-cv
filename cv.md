### Profile: 

I have experience in self-development of pet projects in ***JavaScript*** and ***React.js***. At the moment I am improving my professional skills by developing pet-projects. My peculiarity as a professional is that I like to delve into the subtleties and technical details of a programming language or any system. I see my goal as a developer in constant progress and development of my skills and knowledge. At the moment, I study web development mainly from the ***front-end*** side. Going forward, I see myself as a ***full-stack*** developer with a shift in focus towards ***back-end*** development. I like difficult challenges and interesting projects. Projects with a focus on performance and modern technologies. I like to be engaged in one product, make it great and be a part of a motivated, focused and professional team.
